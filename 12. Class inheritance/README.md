# Exercise: Inheritance in C++

## Objective
Create a program that models a simple hierarchy of classes using inheritance. You will create a base class Shape and derive two classes Rectangle and Circle from it. Each derived class will implement functions to calculate the area and perimeter of the shapes.

## Requirements

- Base Class Shape: Define a base class named Shape containing
    - A protected attribute name to hold the name of the shape.
    - A public method printName() that prints the shape's name.
    - Two pure virtual functions:
        - double area() to calculate the area of the shape.
        - double perimeter() to calculate the perimeter of the shape.

- Derived Class Rectangle:
    - Inherit from Shape and represent a rectangle.
    - Add private attributes width and height.
    - Implement the area() and perimeter() functions.

- Derived Class Circle:
    - Inherit from Shape and represent a circle.
    - Add a private attribute radius.
    - Implement the area() and perimeter() functions.

- Main Function:
    - Create instances of Rectangle and Circle.
    - Set their dimensions.
    - Print their names, areas, and perimeters.

## Hints
Use the keyword virtual in the base class to define pure virtual functions, making Shape an abstract class.
Use the override keyword in the derived classes when implementing the inherited virtual functions.
For the Rectangle, the area is calculated as width * height, and the perimeter is 2 * (width + height).
For the Circle, the area is π * radius * radius, and the perimeter (circumference) is 2 * π * radius. Use the constant M_PI from <cmath> for π.

## Expected Output
When you run your program, it should print something like:

```commandline
Shape: Rectangle
Area: 20
Perimeter: 18

Shape: Circle
Area: 28.2743
Perimeter: 18.8496
```
