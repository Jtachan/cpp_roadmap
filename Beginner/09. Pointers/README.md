# Exercise 9: Understanding Pointers
## Objective
This exercise will help you get familiar with pointers by manipulating them in different ways.

## Tasks

- Pointer Basics: Declare an integer variable and a pointer that points to it. Output the value of the integer, the pointer, and the value at the pointer (dereferencing).
- Pointer Arithmetic:Use pointer arithmetic to manipulate the pointer and observe how it changes the value it points to.
- Using Pointers with Arrays: Create an array and use a pointer to iterate over the array elements.
- Swapping Values: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.


## Expected result
The program will:
 - Show the basics of pointer usage.
 - Demonstrate pointer arithmetic.
 - Swap two values using a pointer-based function.
