# C++ roadmap

This repository contains a set of exercises with the purpose of learning/improving C++ for anyone.

## Exercises

Each exercise is defined with a 'readme' file, containing the following sections:

- **Objective**: Brief explanation of the main objective of the exercise.
- **Task**: Instructions to be included in the program.
- **Expected result**: The expected outcome when the program runs.
- **C++ theory**: The needed theory to complete the exercise.

Additionally, within each exercise folder are contained the `.cpp` and `.h` files needed to create and run the program successfully.

> Note: Each exercise assumes that the theory from the previous exercises is known.
