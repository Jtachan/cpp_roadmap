# Exercise 4: Number Guessing Game
## Objective
Learn how to use loops (while or do-while) and conditional statements together to create a simple game.

## Task
Write a program that:
- Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 (you can use rand() function).
- Asks the user to guess the number.
- Keeps asking the user for a guess until they guess the correct number.
- Provides feedback after each guess:
  - If the guess is too high, print "Too high!"
  - If the guess is too low, print "Too low!"
  - When the user guesses the correct number, print "Congratulations! You've guessed the number!"


## Expected Result:
The program will continue asking for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

```commandline
Guess the number (1-100): 50
Too high!
Guess the number (1-100): 25
Too low!
Guess the number (1-100): 37
Congratulations! You've guessed the number!
