# Exercise 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations
## Objective
Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations and work with different data types.

## Task
Write a program that:

- Asks the user to input two integers.
- Performs the following operations on those integers:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
- Outputs the result of each operation in a readable format.
  
## Expected Result:
If the user inputs 10 and 5 as the two integers, the program should output:

```commandline
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2
```
